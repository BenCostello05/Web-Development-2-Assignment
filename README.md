# Web-Development-2-Assignment
This is a library system that I built with PHP, html and CSS for my Web Development 2 assignment in my second year of college. I used visual studio code and I hosted it locally using XAMPP which provided the apache server and mySQL databse needed for the application. The system allows the user to log into their acccount or register for a new account. Once they are logged in they can start search and reserving book and manage the books they already have reserved. It can search by title and/or author or by cataegory description using a dropdown menu. The log in and all books searched is retrievd fro the database. All the code can be found in the Library System folder. The pdf document contains an overview of the code,how each page works and looks and finally my design.
